        Billing tiers are broken down by whether the traffic is entirely within the network
        or off the network, and whether the subscriber is initiating or receiving the SMS or call.
        <ul>
          <li>
          <strong>On-Network Sending Traffic Prices</strong>:
          Subscriber A on your network calls Subscriber B, who is also on your network.
          The prices in this tier are for the sender, Subscriber A.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Off-Network Sending Traffic Prices</strong>:
          Subscriber A on your network sends a message to someone not on your network.
          These are the prices for the sender, Subscriber A.
          These prices are where you as the operator will incur the most fees.
          Accordingly, the cost four your subscribers should be higher.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>On-Network Receiving Traffic Prices</strong>:
          Subscriber A on your network sends a message to Subscriber B, who is also on your network.
          The prices in this tier are for the recipient, Subscriber B.
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Off-Network Receiving Traffic Prices</strong>:
          Subscriber A on your network receives a message from someone not on your network.
          These are the prices for the recipient, Subscriber A.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        In each billing tier, you will see two prices each for two services.
        One price is the amount you charge your subscribers
        per SMS sent or per minute of a call.
        The cost to your subscribers can be modified by you on this page.
        The second price you will see is the cost to you, the operator,
        that {% tmpl_const "SITENAME" %} charges based on activity from your subscribers.
        Off-network outbound traffic is the most expensive,
        and the costs will vary greatly based on the country being contacted.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here is an example cost scenario for you and a subscriber.
        If a subscriber on your network makes a call to
        {{ example.country_name }},
        the costs will come from {{ example.country_name }}'s
        billing tier: "{{ example.billing_tier_name }}".
        That means, based on your current price settings for calls to this tier:
        <ul>
          <li>
            your subscriber will be charged {{ example.cost_to_subscriber_per_min }}
            {{ subscriber_currency }} per minute of the call
          </li>
          <li>
            {% tmpl_const "SITENAME" %} will charge you ${{ example.cost_to_operator_per_min }}
            per minute of this call
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p class='billing-tier-traffic-enable-or-disable'>
        If you find it is too expensive to connect a certain tier of countries,
        you may completely disable outbound service to those countries with the
        checkboxes below.  Inbound traffic will contine to function as normal
        even if outbound traffic is disabled.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please contact support if you have any questions
        regarding billing, connectivity or the cost of services for you and your subscribers.

      <strong>Billing Tiers</strong>
      <p>
      This page allows you to set the prices your subscribers will pay
      as they use voice and SMS services.
      It also shows the costs you, the operator, will incur as you run the network.
      </p>
      <p>
      Prices are based on whether an SMS or call was made,
      whether the activity took place entirely within your network,
      and whether your subscriber sent or received the SMS or call.
      For calls and SMS that were initiated by your subscriber and leave your network,
      the cost is dependent on which country is being contacted.
      The differences in countries are captured in
      the four "sending out of network" tiers listed below.
